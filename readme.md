# CC-JQuery-WorkDayScheduler

## Description

This project is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of JQuery to dynamically update HTML and CSS.  
This project also demonstrates how to store and retrieve data from localStorage and how to direct locations using element IDs.  
The goal is to refactor code to create a simple calendar app that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9a - 5p).

## Tests
1.  Test that the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.  
2.  Test that time blocks for standard business hours (9a - 5p)  are presented on scroll down.  
3.  Test that blocks of time are color-coded based on past, present, or future time when time blocks are viewed.  
4.  Test that events can be entered when a time block is clicked on.  
5.  Test that the text for the event is saved in local storage upon saving.
